Using the Reverse Engineer Database tool made available in MYSQL workbench, I created an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to show the 
pictorial representation of the data relationships available in the classic_model database.
The ERD also displays how the primary key, foreign key, and composite key are used to link the tables. 
these keys are represented with different icons from the regular column names.
